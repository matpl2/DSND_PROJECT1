# Project 1 - Write A Data Science Blog Post
This file is a documentation file for an exercise performed as a part of Data Scientist NanoDegree project 1 - Write a Data Science blog. 

Purpose of this project is to write a blog that will be supported by data exercise. In this file I will describe most useful information related to files I have uploaded to the repository. Files included are:

  - Project 1.ipnb - jupyter notebook.
  - Project 1.html - jupyter notebook exported to html file.
  - licence file.
  - data SEA.zip - zip file with data exported from Kaggle.
 
## Purpose and intent
Dataset is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data. Purpose of this exercise is to find answer to 3 questions (provide 3 insights):

Question 1 - Does cleaning fee impact cleanliness that was assessed by visitors in the review scores cleanliness rank?

Question 2 - Does the host tenure on AirBnB impact the accuracy of property description?

Question 3 - Which areas of Seattle get the best scores on the location?


## Code
Data analysis was executed in a Jupyter notebook that operates on Python 3 Kernel (Anaconda). Python libraries used for this project includes:

* numpy - https://numpy.org/
* pandas - https://pandas.pydata.org/
* pyplot - https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html
* sklearn modules: linelar_model, r2_score, model_selection - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
* seaborn - https://seaborn.pydata.org/

## Analytics Process
Process outlined in the Project file follows the CRISP-DM Process (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining). You can see inside the file that multiple steps were taken to prepare data: drop nan values, change data types, or remove special characters from the data. File was documented with comments therefore each step has instruction associated with it. 

## Outcome of the analysis
Analysis has provided answers to 3 business questions. You are encouraged to dive more into the dataset.
